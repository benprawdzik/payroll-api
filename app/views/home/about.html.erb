				<b>The Problem</b>
				<br/><br/>
				Onboarding your contractor and managing international payment can get messy and complicated. The whole process is often done manually and involves a lot of paperwork, spreadsheets, timesheets and time. A LOT of time.

				<b>The Solution</b>
				<br/><br/>
				Nobody should have to go through that every month. Verix makes the whole process a lot easier while ensuring your contractors are always paid on time with a payment method of their choice.
				Using Deel for payouts is easy. Onboarding your contractors and setting up contracts with them will take one minute and you are all set. At the agreed time of the month, you make a single payment, regardless of the amount of contractors you have, and we take care of the distribution.
